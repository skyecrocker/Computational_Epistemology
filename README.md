# Computational_Epistemology

### bandit_utils

Contains the core logic of the network, agents, etc... used in bandit simulations

### old_code_NoLongerInUSe

Used to generate some of the data in the past, so keeping it just in case. But everything has now been streamlined into a few generalized scripts.

### epistemic_landscapes

starting work for epistemic landscape simulation paradigm

### data_analysis.ipynb

Code for generating plots and viewing results

### simulation_master.py

Script for running most simulations, including both Wagner and Herington setup and Zollman setup, as well as adding inertia or epsilon parameters.

### individual_time.py

Simulations that keep track of and record individuals throughout the simulation. Output files significantly larger.

## Not Included

Not included in this repo are the output csv files and reference code.
