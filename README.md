# Computational_Epistemology

### bandit_utils

Contains the core logic of the network, agents, etc... used in bandit simulations

### Old_Code_NoLongerInUSe

Used to generate some of the data in the past, so keeping it just in case. But everything has now been streamlined into a few generalized scripts.

### Epistemic_landscapes

starting work for epistemic landscape simulation paradigm

### Data_analysis.ipynb

Code for generating plots and viewing results

### Simulation_master.py

Script for running most simulations, including both Wagner and Herington setup and Zollman setup, as well as adding inertia or epsilon parameters.

### Individual_time.py

Simulations that keep track of and record individuals throughout the simulation. Output files significantly larger.

## Not Included

Not included in this repo are the output csv files and reference code.
